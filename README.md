# termux-ubuntu

A script to install Ubuntu chroot in Termux

The script will make its files in the current directory. So if you want your Ubuntu-filesystem at a particular location switch to that folder first and then call the script with it's relative path. Example:
`update works for me let me know ``
just one command
./ubuntu.sh
